# odin-etch-a-sketch

### This is a basic representation of an etch-a-sketch.
### Currently the game displays a color when the mouse hovers over a grid square.
### There are 5 buttons in this game.

#### 1) A grid resizer which changes the number of cells in the grid.
#### 2) A toggle color which changes the color of the pen to a user defined color.
#### 3) A toggle rainbow color which changes the color back to random color.
#### 4) An eraser button which will erase the cells over which the mouse will go.
#### 5) A reset grid button which will reset the grid back to a 16 x 16 one.

## ToDo:

### Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

### Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.

## Completed:

### Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely. (✅)
