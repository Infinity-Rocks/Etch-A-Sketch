# odin-etch-a-sketch

### This is a basic representation of an etch-a-sketch.
### Currently the game displays a color when the mouse hovers over a grid square.
### A button is added to change the size of the grid as per user's request.

## ToDo:

### Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

### Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value entirely.
### Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
